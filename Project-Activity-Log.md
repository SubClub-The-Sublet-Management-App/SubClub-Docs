# Project Activity Log

Welcome to the activity log of my SubClub fullstack web app project. This document serves as a daily record of progress, providing a clear overview of each day's tasks and achievements.

In this log you will find the date, the daily goals and a summary of what has been achieved. For clarity, a screenshot of the Trello board is included at the end of each day, providing a visual summary of the project status.

This activity log is not only a tool for personal accountability, but also a valuable resource for self-assessment and future planning.

## Day 1

#### Date: Thu 16 Nov 2023

We start our solo full stack Project!

It has been a busy but productive day and this is what I have achieved today:

* I found a problem I was passionate about and devised a solution for it using technology.
* I posted the idea on the discord channel and got the project approved by the educators.
* I created the project's Trello board, wrote down the requirements and the tasks planned to meet the rubrics.
* I have created a GitHub organisation and a dedicated repository for the project documentation.
* I have created another mardown file to keep track of the project activity log (this one).

## Day 2

#### Date: Fri 17 Nov 2023

**Goals:**

* Write project description with the specification of the project including: purpose, functionality/features, target audience, and the tech stack (25 Trello card).
* Research about Agile methodology and write how to apply it to the project (34 Trello card).
* Research third parties services for that need it for app features (35 Trello card).
* Create at least 3 user stories (persona) for each target audience.

**Achievements and reflexion of the day:**

So far I have completed most of the tasks of the day. I started with researching the third party services and packages that I need for the development of the application, however, I hit a roadblock as I needed to know more about the users' needs.  I spent the afternoon talking to friends who had sublet before and asked them about their experiences and struggles. Having this information I started the creation of the user stories and put on hold the third party services for the application.

## Day 3

#### Date: Sat 18 Nov 2023

**Goals:**

* Finish the user stories
* Create the user persona cards

**Achievements and reflexion of the day:**

I've only worked a couple of hours on the project today, I've written some of the user stories and started working on the user cards.
For the cards I have decided to do them on canvas, so they are still a work in progress.

## Day 4

#### Date: Sun 19 Nov 2023

**Goals:**

* Finish user stories
* Finish user persona cards

**Achievements and reflexion of the day:**

My main goal was to finalise the card people who represent the potential users of my app. However I realised that the more I created the more I was repeating myself, so I managed to compress potential users into 3 user personas and spent more time writing more user stories than I had initially.
I met my goal for today and additionally wrote a "business case" to give more context on who the target users are.

**Task added to card(28)**
