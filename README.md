# Project: SubClub - The Sublet Management App

## Project Description:


### Problem Statement
The State of Victoria is experiencing a severe and continual rental crisis. This is marked by contributing factors that are making housing less affordable for renters.

Contributing factors may include:

The fall in supply due to lack of construction of new homes and dwellings
The lack of buildings repurposed for residential living
Increased taxes on investors, which has driven investors out from the residential market meaning more housing stock is being bought by owner occupiers. This in turn is negatively impacting the number of available rental properties on the market.
Increasing costs of energy impact the cost of living
Increased positive net migration driving up further demand in the rental market
Reduction to the total available medium to long term housing stock as homes have been repurposed for short-term stays (on a scale of days to weeks) for holiday and vacation rentals. E.g. AirBnB and Stayz
Increased cash rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia

As a result, more individuals are turning to shared living arrangements to cope with the housing demand. Many of these individuals (subletters and owner-occupiers with one or more unoccupied rooms or granny flats) are time poor and lack the experience needed to efficiently manage the subletting of their spare rooms to share the burden of higher rents or interest rates.


### Solution Statement
Sub.club is a web application that is used by Subletters to address the challenges of subletting. The application provides  a comprehensive solution for individuals looking to rent out their rooms for medium to long term (3 to 12 months).

This web application streamlines the process of managing agreements, sending timely payment reminders and recording payments and creating payment receipts.


## Key features:

With the sub.club web app, subletters are able to:

* Register new user account.
* Login and logout of user account.
* Create, update and view rooms (with the description of the room features and what is included in the rent).
* Create, update and view sub-tenant information.
* Create, update and view room assignments (subtenant(s), room and a date range).
    * When a room assignment is created, a printable lease agreement is automatically generated. This contract is based on the agreement of both parties and describes what is included in the rent, such as utilities, items accompanying the room (if furnished), cleaning services and access to shared common areas.
* Create (Registrated) and view past payments.
    * When a payment is created in the system, a payments receipt is auto-generated and is print friendly.


## Target Audiences

* Owner occupiers 
* Tenants who have a lease agreement with their landlord that they can sublet.
